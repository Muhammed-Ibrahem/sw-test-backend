## 🗃 Database Setup

Inside the `/database` folder:

database/
 ┣ schema.sql     → Database structure
 ┣ seeder.php     → Populates tables with mock data
 ┗ data.json      → Contains the seed data
```

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_NAME=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### Create & Seed

1. Create an empty database.
2. Import the schema:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p [DatabaseName] < database/schema.sql
   ```
3. Run the seeder:
   ```bash
   php database/seeder.php
   ```
   This reads from `data.json` and populates the tables.
   Make sure the `.env` file is created and have the required values
